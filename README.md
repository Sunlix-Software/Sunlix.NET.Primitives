**Sunlix.NET.Primitives** is a lightweight library providing a set of key types for structured domain modeling in C#. It includes core abstractions such as *Entity*, *Value Object*, *Aggregate Root*, and *Domain Events*, essential for implementing domain-driven design (DDD) principles. Additionally, it provides *Enumeration* for defining strongly-typed sets of named values and *Error* for structured error handling. The library is designed to be extensible, intuitive, and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of applications where well-structured domain models are needed.

## Installation
#### NuGet Package  
The package is available on NuGet. You can install it using the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Sunlix.NET.Primitives
```  
#### Minimum Requirements  
Compatible with **.NET 6**, **.NET 8**, and **.NET 9**.  

The library has no external dependencies and can be used in any .NET application.

##  Overview of Core Concepts


##  Usage
### Entity
An **Entity** represents an object with a distinct and persistent identity, uniquely identified by an identifier rather than its attributes. Entities are designed to model domain concepts that require continuity over time, ensuring that their identity remains stable despite changes to their attributes. Entities enable the tracking and management of domain objects with unique identities, such as users, orders, or products, within the context of a domain model.

#### üéØ Key Characteristics
- **Identity-based equality** ‚Äì Two entities are equal if they share the same `Id`.
- **Persistence** ‚Äì Entity identity remains constant throughout its lifecycle.
- **Mutable attributes** ‚Äì The values of an entity's attributes may change, but its identity does not.

**üìù Example:**
```csharp
public class Order : Entity<int>
{
    public Money TotalAmount { get; set; }

    public Order() { }

    public Order(int id, Money totalAmount) : base(id)
    {
        TotalAmount = totalAmount;
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Equality Rules
Entities follow identifier equality rather than structural equality.

| Scenario | Explanation | Result |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Same object reference | *Both variables point to the same object in memory, so they are inherently equal.* | ‚úÖ |
| Same type, same Id | *Entities of the same type with matching Id values are considered equal, regardless of attributes.* | ‚úÖ |
| Same type, different Id | *Entities of the same type but with different Id values are not equal.* | ‚ùå |
| Different type | *Entities must be of the same type to be considered equal, even if their Id values match.* | ‚ùå |
| Other entity is null | *An Entity cannot be equal to null; equals returns false for null comparisons.* | ‚ùå |
| Default Id (null or default(TId)) | *Entities with default Id values (e.g., null or 0) are not considered equal, as default Id typically indicates an uninitialized state.* | ‚ùå |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** *if one entity inherits from another and they share the same Id, they will still not be considered equal.*

**üìù Example**:
```csharp
// Same object reference
var order1 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 10);
var order2 = order1;
order1.Equals(order2));                            // ‚úÖ True

// Same type, same Id
var order1 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 10);
var order2 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 20);
order1.Equals(order2));                            // ‚úÖ True

// Same type, different Id
var order1 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 10);
var order2 = new Order(id: 2, totalAmount: 20);
order1.Equals(order2));                            // ‚ùå False

// Different type
var order1 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 10);
var user1 = new User(id: 1, ssn: "123-45-6789");
order1.Equals(user1));                             // ‚ùå False

// Other entity is null
var order1 = new Order(id: 1, totalAmount: 10);
order1.Equals(null!));                             // ‚ùå False

// Default Id (null or default(TId))
var order1 = new Order();
var order2 = new Order();
order1.Equals(order2));                            // ‚ùå False
```
